## 🔒 Security Considerations

Due to time constraints during the hackathon, we acknowledge that the current version of CreatiVision may not have comprehensive security measures in place. We recognize the importance of robust security in AI-powered applications and plan to prioritize the following improvements in future updates:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization
- Securing API endpoints and data transmission
- Enhancing input validation and sanitization
- Implementing rate limiting and other anti-abuse measures
- Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations

We are committed to addressing these security concerns to provide a safe and reliable tool for our users.
